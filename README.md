## Form Input Validation

### Intro

We encounter forms all over the web.  So you can probably imagine that working with forms can be a big part of a developer 's job.  One of the most important parts of working with forms is validating the data entered into the form before sending it off to the server. Hereâ€™s a lightweight app that creates custom form input validation. JavaScript is used to listen for changes on form inputs or sections.  And then tests how the user has interacted with the form to determine if the results are usable.  And if not, it prevents the form from submitting and notifies the user in some way.

### Instructions
